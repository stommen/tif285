The use of probability theory to quantify uncertainty plays a central role in science and the scientific method for inferring new knowledge about the universe. Before we can elaborate on this topic of inductive inference we must briefly discuss the nature of science in terms of data, theories, and models. In later chapters we will exemplify this using a linear model and some test data. But for now we will remain general and slightly more abstract. A large fraction of the text in this chapter was written by Andreas Ekström.

## Data and models
Let us start with the *data* $\data$ already obtained through a measurement process, e.g., an experiment in a laboratory or an observation of some astronomical event. It is obviously so that all data are equipped with uncertainties of various origin, let us denote this $\delta \data$. Surely you can think of several examples. Nevertheless, given some data $\data$, one would immediately ask what this data can tell us about data we have not yet collected or used in the inference. We call this future data $\futuredata$. At present, we are uncertain about any future data, and we describe as a (conditional) probability $\cprob{\futuredata}{\data,I}$. All we have said so far is that _predictions are uncertain_. The obvious and interesting question is: how uncertain is the prediction? To answer that, we must go from this abstract probability to something that we can evaluate quantitatively. The first step is to develop a *theory*, e.g., Newtonian mechanics, within which we can define a *model* to describe, e.g., the structural stability of a residential house or some planetary motion, to analyze the relevant data.

In physics, a *theory* is very often some framework that postulates, or deduces from some axioms, a master equation that governs the spacetime dependence of a system of interacting bodies, e.g., Einstein’s field equations in the general theory of relativity or Heisenberg’s equations of motion in quantum mechanics. There is no recipe for how to develop a realistic theory. All we can do is to use our imagination, try to discover patterns and/or symmetries, collaborate with other experts, and have some luck on the way! No theory is complete and we always seek improvement or sometimes face a fundamental change of interpretation, i.e., a paradigm shift. In that sense, a theory always comes with some probability for being true, and, besides for purely logical statements, this probability can never be exactly 0 or 1. In such cases, no new evidence/data will ever have any influence. In this sense, *all theories are wrong*, i.e., they are never correct with absolute certainty. This is at some level a provocative statement that is designed to draw attention to the fact that all theories can be improved or replaced, and we do this all the time using the scientific method described in the introduction section about [](intro:inference).

A physical *model* $M$ allows quantitative evaluation of the system under study. Any model we employ will always depend on model parameters $\pars$ with uncertain numerical values. Moreover, *all models are wrong*. Indeed, there will always be some physics that we have neglected to include or are unaware of today. If we denote mismatch between model predictions and real world observations of the system, i.e., data, as $\delta M$, we can write

$$
\data = M(\pars) + \delta \data + \delta M.
$$ (eq:DataModelsPredictions:mismatch)

The mismatch term $\delta M$ is often referred to as a model discrepancy. We are uncertain also about this term, so it must be represented as a random variable that is distributed in accordance with our beliefs about $\delta M$. It is no trivial task to incorporate model discrepancies in the analysis of scientific models and data, yet it is crucial to avoid overfitting the model parameters $\pars$ and make overly confident model predictions. Although important, we will for the most part in this course neglect $\delta M$. There is simply no time to cover also this aspect of the scientific method. Note that the model discrepancy remains present even if there is no uncertainty about $\pars$. In the following we subsume the choice of model and other decisions into the set of background knowledge $I$.

## The posterior predictive distribution
The distribution of future data conditioned on past data and background information, i.e., $\pdf{\futuredata}{\data,I}$, is called a posterior predictive distribution. Assuming that we have a model $M(\pars)$ for the data-generating mechanism we can express this distribution by marginalizing over the uncertain model parameters $\pars \in \Omega$

```{math}
:label: eq_ppd
\pdf{\futuredata}{\data,I} = \int_{\Omega} \pdf{\futuredata}{\pars,I}\pdf{\pars}{\data,I}\,{\rm d} \pars.
```

By performing this integral we account for the uncertainty in the model parameters $\pars$ when making predictions. In fact, one can marginalize (average) predictions over anything and everything that we are uncertain about as long as we have access to the necessary probability distributions. To evaluate the posterior for the model parameters we must employ Bayes' theorem

```{math}
:label: eq_bayes
\pdf{\pars}{\data,I} = \frac{\pdf{\data}{\pars,I}\pdf{\pars}{I}}{\pdf{\data}{I}}.
```

Here, we must insert a likelihood of the data $\pdf{\data}{\pars,I}$ and a prior distribution of the model parameters $\pdf{\pars}{I}$. Unless we are able to select very particular combinations of likelihood and prior distributions we must use numerical methods to evaluate the posterior predictive distribution. We will discuss the likelihood and prior in great detail in the next chapter, and also specialize to a case where we can perform the marginal integral in Eq. {eq}`eq_ppd` analytically. The denominator in Eq. {eq}`eq_bayes` is sometimes referred to as the marginal likelihood or the evidence and normalizes the left-hand side such that it integrates to unity, i.e., we have

\begin{equation}
\pdf{\data}{I} = \int_{\Omega} \pdf{\data}{\pars} \pdf{\pars}{I}\, {\rm d}\pars.
\end{equation}

Unless we are interested in obtaining an absolutely normalized posterior distribution we can omit the denominator in Eq. {eq}`eq_bayes`. Indeed, this does not explicitly depend on $\pars$. 

## Bayesian parameter estimation
Quantifying the posterior distribution $\pdf{\pars}{\data,I}$ for the parameters of a model is called Bayesian parameter estimation, and is a staple of Bayesian inference. This is a probabilistic generalization of parameter optimization and maximum likelihood estimation whereby one tries to find an extremum parameter value of some objective function or data likelihood, respectively. We will see examples of this in the chapter on [](sec:LinearModels).

Bayesian parameter estimation can sometimes be very challenging. In the chapter on [](sec:BayesianLinearRegression) we will se an example of where we can perform analytical calculations throughout. However, in most realistic applications the posterior must be evaluated numerically, and most often using [](sec:MCMC). This is no silver bullet and to quantify (or characterize) a multi-dimensional posterior, sometimes with a complicated geometry, for an intricate physical model, is by no means guaranteed to succeed. At least not in finite time. Nevertheless, obtaining posterior distributions to represent uncertainties is the gold standard in any inferential analysis.

Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, there are goats. You pick a door, say No. 1. This door remains closed. Instead, the game-show host, who knows what's behind all three doors, opens another door where he knows there will be a goat, say No. 3, which indeed has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your initial choice of door? Motivate your answer using Bayes' theorem. (This is a famous problem known as *the Monty Hall problem*)

Assume we have three coins in a bag. All three coins feel and look the same, but we are told that: the first coin is biased with a 0.75 probability of obtaining heads when flipped -- the second coin is fair, i.e., 0.5 probability of obtaining heads -- the third coin is biased towards tails with a 0.25 probability of coming up heads.

Assume that you reach your hand into the bag and pick a coin randomly, then flip it and obtain heads. What is the probability for obtaining heads if you flip it once more?

Let $r$ be rain, $\bar{r}$ be not rain, and $p$ be rain predicted. We seek $\prob(r|p,I)$, where $I$ is the background information we were given in the problem definition. Let us use Bayes' theorem

$$
\prob(r|p,I) = \frac{ \prob(p|r,I)\prob(r|I)}{\prob(p|I) } = \frac{\prob(p|r,I)\prob(r|I)}{\prob(p|r,I)\prob(r|I) + \prob(p|\bar{r},I)\prob(\bar{r}|I) }
$$

With $\prob(r|I) = 0.6$, $\prob(\bar{r}|I) = 0.4$, $\prob(p|r,I) = 0.75$, $\prob(p|\bar{r},I) = 0.45$, we have $\prob(r|p,I) \approx 0.71$

You should switch to door No. 2 to increase your chance of winning the car. This, somewhat counter-intuitive, result can be obtained using Bayesian reasoning.

Let us introduce some notation for different events: $p_i = $ (the player initially picks door $i$), $h_j = $ (Monty opens door $j$), $c_k = $(car is behind door $k$). In the problem definition we had the series of events $p_1$ and $h_3$, and now we would like to know which probability is the greatest: $\prob(c_1|p_1h_3)$ or $\prob(c_2|p_1h_3)$? Let's compute them:

This is the probability that the car is behind door 1:

$$
\prob(c_1|p_1h_3) = \frac{\prob(h_3|c_1p_1)\prob(c_1p_1)}{\prob(p_1h_3)} = \frac{\prob(h_3|c_1p_1)\prob(c_1)\prob(p_1)}{\prob(h_3|p_1)\prob(p_1)} = \frac{\prob(h_3|c_1p_1)\prob(c_1)}{\prob(h_3|p_1)}
$$

We have $\prob(h_3|c_1p_1)=1/2$ (since Monty can open doors 2 or 3), $\prob(c_1) = 1/3$ (car can be placed initially behind any of the three doors), $\prob(h_3|p_1) = 1/2$ (this probability is independent of car location!). Combined, this gives us that $\prob(c_1|p_1h_3) = 1/3$

Now we compute the probability that the car is behind door 2:

$$
\prob(c_2|p_1h_3) = \frac{\prob(h_3|c_2p_1)\prob(c_2p_1)}{\prob(p_1h_3)} = \frac{\prob(h_3|c_2p_1)\prob(c_2)\prob(p_1)}{\prob(h_3|p_1)\prob(p_1)} = \frac{\prob(h_3|c_2p_1)\prob(c_2)}{\prob(h_3|p_1)}
$$

We have $\prob(h_3|c_2p_1)=1$ (since Monty can only open door 3), $\prob(c_2) = 1/3$ (car can be placed initially behind any of the three doors), $\prob(h_3|p_1) = 1/2$ (this probability is independent of car location!). Combined, this gives us that $\prob(c_2|p_1h_3) = 2/3$

So, you have a higher probability of getting the car if you change your initial pick from door number 1 to door number 2.

You can convince yourself that this is true by considering an extreme version of the game show where there are 100 doors, 99 goats, and 1 car. You first pick one door. After this, Monty opens 98 doors where he knows there are goats. There's only one door left closed at this point. Would you switch?

Let $H/T$ denote the result of a coin flip coming up heads/tails. We seek the posterior predictive probability

$$
\prob(\mathcal{F}=H|\mathcal{D}=H,I)
$$

where $I$ is the information given in the problem definition. We do not know which one out of the three coins we are flipping, so the appropriate thing to do is to marginalize with respect to the coin type. Let us number the coins using the discrete random variable $C=1,2,3$. This gives us the following expression for the posterior predictive probability

$$
\prob(\mathcal{F}=H|\mathcal{D}=H,I) = \sum_{C=1}^{3} \prob(\mathcal{F}=H,C|\mathcal{D}=H,I) = \sum_{C=1}^{3} \prob(\mathcal{F}=H|C,I)\prob(C|\mathcal{D}=H,I),
$$

where we used the product rule of probabilities in the last step and that once we have knowledge of $C$ then the probability $\prob(\mathcal{F}=H|C,I)$ is conditionally independent of previous coin flips.

The left-hand factor in the last step is a likelihood, and we know that $\prob(\mathcal{F}=H|C=1,I) = 0.75$, $\prob(\mathcal{F}=H|C=2,I) = 0.5$, and $\prob(\mathcal{F}=H|C=3,I) = 0.25$. The right hand factor is a posterior probability for having coin $C$ if observing heads (in the first flip). To compute this, we must use Bayes' theorem

$$
\prob(C|\mathcal{D}=H,I) = \frac{\prob(\mathcal{D}=H|C,I)\prob(C|I)}{\prob(\mathcal{D}=H|I)}.
$$

Evaluating the denominator

$$
\prob(\mathcal{D}=H|I) = \sum_{C=1}^3 \prob(\mathcal{D}=H|C,I)\prob(C|I) = \frac{3}{4}\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}\frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{2}.
$$

With this, we have for the three coin posteriors

$$
\prob(C=1|\mathcal{D}=H,I) = 2\cdot \frac{3}{4}\cdot\frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{2}.
$$

$$
\prob(C=2|\mathcal{D}=H,I) = 2\cdot \frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{3}.
$$

$$
\prob(C=3|\mathcal{D}=H,I) = 2\cdot \frac{1}{4}\cdot\frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{6}.
$$

We can now evaluate the posterior predictive probability that we set out to obtain in the first place

$$
\prob(\mathcal{F}=H|\mathcal{D}=H,I) = \sum_{C=1}^{3} \prob(\mathcal{F}=H|C,I)\prob(C|\mathcal{D}=H,I) = \frac{3}{4}\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}\frac{1}{6} = \frac{7}{12} \approx 0.58.
$$
